Loading device for application Rf_Device from file '3s250e.nph' in environment C:\Xilinx\14.1\ISE_DS\ISE\.
   "top" is an NCD, version 3.2, device xc3s250e, package tq144, speed -4
WARNING:ConstraintSystem - The Offset constraint <OFFSET = IN 10 ns BEFORE COMP "clk_in";> [top.pcf(90)], is specified
   without a duration.  This will result in a lack of hold time checks in timing reports.  If hold time checks are
   desired a duration value should be specified following the 'VALID' keyword.


Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range: -40.000 to 100.000 Celsius)
Initializing voltage to 1.140 Volts. (default - Range: 1.140 to 1.320 Volts)

Phase 4.2  Initial Clock and IO Placement

........
ERROR:Place:1012 - A clock IOB / DCM component pair have been found that are not placed at an optimal clock IOB / DCM
   site pair.  The clock component <Inst_mid_dcm/DCM_SP_INST> is placed at site <DCM_X1Y1>.  The clock IO/DCM site can
   be paired if they are placed/locked in the same quadrant.  The IO component <clk_in> is placed at site <IPAD108>. 
   This will not allow the use of the fast path between the IO and the Clock buffer. If this sub optimal condition is
   acceptable for this design, you may use the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint in the .ucf file to demote this message
   to a WARNING and allow your design to continue. However, the use of this override is highly discouraged as it may
   lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design. A list of
   all the COMP.PINs used in this clock placement rule is listed below. These examples can be used directly in the .ucf
   file to override this clock rule.
   < NET "clk_in" CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE = FALSE; >
   < PIN "Inst_mid_dcm/DCM_SP_INST.CLKIN" CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE = FALSE; >

* Some of the Clock networks are NOT completely routed

* Net Skew is the difference between the minimum and maximum routing
only delays for the net. Note this is different from Clock Skew which
is reported in TRCE timing report. Clock Skew is the difference between
the minimum and maximum path delays which includes logic delays.

* The fanout is the number of component pins not the individual BEL loads,
for example SLICE loads not FF loads.

Timing Score: 0 (Setup: 0, Hold: 0, Component Switching Limit: 0)

124 signals are not completely routed. See the top.unroutes file for a list of all unrouted signals.

WARNING:Par:100 - Design is not completely routed. There are 124 signals that are not
   completely routed in this design. See the "top.unroutes" file for a list of
   all unrouted signals. Check for other warnings in your PAR report that might
   indicate why these nets are unroutable. These nets can also be evaluated
   in FPGA Editor by selecting "Unrouted Nets" in the List Window.
