INFO:ConstraintSystem:178 - TNM 'clk_in', used in period specification
   'TS_clk_in', was traced into DCM_SP instance Inst_low_dcm/DCM_SP_INST. The
   following new TNM groups and period specifications were generated at the
   DCM_SP output(s): 
   CLKDV: <TIMESPEC TS_Inst_low_dcm_CLKDV_BUF = PERIOD "Inst_low_dcm_CLKDV_BUF"
   TS_clk_in * 16 HIGH 50%>

INFO:ConstraintSystem:178 - TNM 'clk_in', used in period specification
   'TS_clk_in', was traced into DCM_SP instance Inst_mid_dcm/DCM_SP_INST. The
   following new TNM groups and period specifications were generated at the
   DCM_SP output(s): 
   CLKFX: <TIMESPEC TS_Inst_mid_dcm_CLKFX_BUF = PERIOD "Inst_mid_dcm_CLKFX_BUF"
   TS_clk_in / 4.166666667 HIGH 50%>

WARNING:ConstraintSystem - The Offset constraint <OFFSET = IN 10 ns BEFORE
   "clk_in"  ;> [top.ucf(3)], is specified without a duration.  This will result
   in a lack of hold time checks in timing reports.  If hold time checks are
   desired a duration value should be specified following the 'VALID' keyword.

WARNING:NgdBuild:1212 - User specified non-default attribute value
   (166.6670000000000000) was detected for the CLKIN_PERIOD attribute on DCM
   "Inst_low_dcm/DCM_SP_INST".  This does not match the PERIOD constraint value
   (166.67 ns.).  The uncertainty calculation will use the non-default attribute
   value.  This could result in incorrect uncertainty calculated for DCM output
   clocks.
