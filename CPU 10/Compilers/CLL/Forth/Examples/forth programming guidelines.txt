A list of optional guidelines for programming in forth:

for datastructures/objects:
P_name is a private underlying variable for the structure
NAMESPACE -> NEW is a word to create a new object etc/change the underlying variable for singletons

Words for interacting wih objects
	#Name creates and returns a new object or initialises a singleton or allocates an object
	%Name deletes an object/ deallocates it
	@Name gets some data from an object
	!Name writes some data to an object
	?Name polls the keyboard for data
	.Name prints out data
	>Name (To name) writes data to a structure (eg stack, stream, block)
	Name> (From name) retrieves data from a structure
