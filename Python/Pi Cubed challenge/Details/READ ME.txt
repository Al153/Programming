Hi, and welcome to the Algomac 7.35 (Algorithm machine).

This is Alexander Taylor's entry to the Pi Cubed programming challenge
Algomac is a 16-bit CPU simulator, specifically for exploring the idea of
algorithms and computer science.The Algomac 7.35 is a bridge between the Algomac 7.3
and 7.4, due to it containing the text output functions of 7.4, but not its
keyboard input (due to both the problem of hiding the TKinter window which 
takes user input, whilst being platform independent and taking keypresses
without the need for the user to press "enter" and the fact that taking
changing user input would stop the program running from being a true algorithm!)
Hence one day we may be seeing "Opermac - 7.4"!

Because it does not take user input, everything that each algorithm does is
based on the original state of the machine - much like a very fancy Turing machine.

Specifications:

Architecture: Von Neumann

Main registers: 
	- 16bit accumulator
	- 8bit address register
	- 2x8bit program counter registers
	- 8bit Flags regsiter

Memory:
	- 65536 memory locations, each containing 16 bits ~128KiB
	- 64 word stack

multitasking:
	- 4 sets of "context" storage - each containing a set of all main registers 
	    and a stack
	- Allows for 5 tasks or threads to be switched between (4 in storage, one being run)

ALU:    
	- 16 functions:
		ADD
		SUB
		MUL
		DIV
		MOD
		rev SUB
		rev DIV
		rev MOD
		AND
		OR
		XOR
		NOT
		NAND
		NOR
		shift up
		shift down

GPU:	
	- Outputs to a 256*256 pixel display
	- Draws -lines according to a direction vector
		- Lines linking two points
	- Can toggle the state of each pixel individually

VPU (vector processing unit):
	-Allows for quick calculations involving coordinate (2*8bit unsigned) and
	 directional (2*8bit 2's complement) vectors (useful for graphics).
